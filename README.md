**Predictive Pulse — Harnessing Machine Learning for Blood Pressure Analysis**

## Overview
Predictive Pulse is a machine-learning system designed to predict and monitor systolic and diastolic blood pressure using physiological and lifestyle features. It integrates with wearables and provides real-time alerts, personalized insights, and dashboards for patients and healthcare providers.

## Key Features
- Predict systolic & diastolic blood pressure from user inputs (age, BMI, heart rate, etc.)
- Real-time monitoring with wearable integrations
- Alerts for potential blood-pressure spikes (notifications to patients & providers)
- Dashboard for visualization and trend analysis
- Model export and REST API for easy deployment

## Demo Scenarios
**Scenario 1 — Hypertension Monitoring**  
A patient wearing a compatible wearable receives real-time alerts when the model predicts a blood-pressure spike, enabling medication adjustments or clinician intervention.

**Scenario 2 — Fitness Insights**  
A fitness enthusiast gets long-term BP trend analysis and personalized recommendations to optimize workouts and reduce cardiovascular risk.

**Scenario 3 — Population Health**  
A healthcare provider monitors at-risk populations remotely to target interventions and reduce hospitalizations.
